# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [v2.7.1] - 2026-08-28

### Security

- Disables terminal input echo in the `age` pseudo-terminal used by `--password-file` backup, extract, and restore automation, preventing the supplied passphrase from being copied into captured stdout, logs, or automation transcripts.
- Refuses to forward a pseudo-terminal transcript if it contains the supplied passphrase as an echoed line, providing a second fail-closed disclosure boundary even if terminal behavior regresses.

### Fixed

- Propagates the real `age` child exit status through util-linux `script --return` instead of allowing a failed encryption or decryption command to appear successful.

### Verification

- Extends `tests/backup.sh` with bare and prompt-prefixed passphrase disclosure through both stdout and stderr, child exit-status propagation, and normal non-disclosure regression cases.
- Passes isolated live K3s acceptance on `v1.36.3+k3s1` for follow-up behavior commit `925b600`: real password-file encrypted backup, checksum validation, full extraction, and `restore --full --dry-run`; preserves resource, Secret, PVC, marker, Pod identity, and zero-restart state; reports zero passphrase disclosures; removes helper Pods, the disposable Namespace, and both local-path PVs; and leaves unrelated workloads unchanged.

## [v2.7.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- `configure.sh` now asks for the authentication mode (`local-password` or `external-oidc`) directly whenever Dashboard or WebUI is enabled, instead of always asking for a local username/password regardless of the intended `HERMES_AUTH_MODE`. Selecting `local-password` asks the existing username/password questions; selecting `external-oidc` asks for the issuer, Dashboard/WebUI OIDC client IDs, public/redirect URLs, and allow claim/values instead — the two question sets are mutually exclusive, matching the mutually exclusive manifest wiring. All wizard-collected values are written to `hermes.env` and the answers file and pass through `install.sh`'s existing `validate_external_oidc_urls`/`HERMES_AUTH_MODE` validation unchanged; no validation logic is duplicated in the wizard.
- Adds `maintain.sh reconcile-api-key --source secret` for finalizing manual/external PVC migrations: validates the existing Kubernetes Secret without printing it, atomically synchronizes only `API_SERVER_KEY` into persistent `/opt/data/.env`, rolls all enabled internal API consumers together, verifies real Bearer authentication, and removes its helper Pod on success or failure. [Issue #101]
- Adds `maintain.sh reconcile-browser-token --source secret` to converge the Kubernetes Browserless token/CDP Secrets, persistent root and profile `.env` files, and every enabled consumer without printing credentials. Verification accepts only Ready Pods carrying the exact Secret revisions and a fresh reconciliation request, then executes `Browser.getVersion` from each consumer.

### Changed

- Node.js, npm, and npx are now installed unconditionally in every profile and every installation, replacing the `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` toggle. The npm cache directory (`/opt/data/.npm`), `npm_config_yes=true` (Agent, WebUI, and the terminal profile hook), and the WebUI `prepare-browser-cli` npm/npx copy no longer depend on any conditional; they are part of the baseline runtime.
- Removes `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` and `HERMES_PROFILE_DEFAULT_NPX_SETUP` from `install.sh`, `configure.sh` (interactive prompt, answers file, validation), `scripts/render_template.py` (boolean validation), all three bootstrap profile `defaults.conf` files, and `examples/hermes.env.example`. Operators upgrading from an installation with `HERMES_NPX_SETUP=false` in `hermes.env` are unaffected: the variable is simply ignored by the new installer/renderer.
- Updates `docs/operations.md` and `docs/pvc-and-containers.md` to describe Node/npm/npx as always-on infrastructure rather than a toggle.
- Updates `tests/qa-contract.sh`, `tests/profile-composition.sh`, `tests/configure.sh`, `tests/interactive-profile-defaults.py`, `tests/profile-resolution-model.py`, `tests/ssh-identity.sh`, and `tests/bootstrap-soul.sh` to drop the NPX matrix dimension; `tests/qa-contract.sh` now asserts `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` is absent from the rendered manifest.
- Fixes `tests/ssh-identity.sh`'s SSH-init-block extraction, which located the end of the block via a `HERMES_NPX_SETUP`-conditional string that no longer exists; it now anchors on `installer_default_soul() {`, the next stable marker in the init job script.

### Fixed

- Forces each internal API-key reconciliation to create exactly one real consumer rollout by adding a fresh non-secret request annotation alongside the Secret revision, then verifies only Ready Pods carrying both values. This prevents an already-current revision annotation from turning reconciliation into a no-op rollout while the Agent keeps an older in-memory key. [Issue #101]
- Reads an existing `/opt/data/.env` through an atomic same-directory hard-link snapshot, rejects symlinked/non-regular targets, and disables service-account-token automounting for storage helper Pods so restore/reconciliation cannot follow a raced credential-file substitution into container credentials.
- Carries forward the WebUI `prepare-browser-cli` fixes from the in-review `fix/persist-node-npm-npx-runtime` branch: resolves the actual `libatomic.so.1` linked by `/usr/local/bin/node` via `ldd` (previously the first `libatomic.so.1*` basename match under `/lib`/`/usr/lib`, which could select an incompatible ELF on images with multiple implementations), and sets `npm_config_yes=true` on the WebUI deployment so WebUI-launched `npx` invocations are non-interactive.
- Preserves a custom `HERMES_WEBUI_IMAGE` loader environment instead of replacing its `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the copied Node runtime directory. `prepare-browser-cli` builds and validates a content-addressed Node/npm/npx runtime under `/opt/data/node/runtimes/<hash>`, then atomically switches `/opt/data/node/current`; stable launchers prepend only the selected runtime's private library directory, preserve inherited paths without duplication, and leave the active runtime unchanged when a candidate dependency or npm payload fails validation. `libatomic.so.1` remains optional unless the source ELF resolves or requires it. [Issue #98]
- Gates Agent and Dashboard readiness/liveness with a 180-second startup-probe budget, allowing readiness to restore traffic immediately after startup succeeds without exposing traffic early or racing slow full-stack restarts.
- Prevents migrated profile `.env` files from overriding the current Kubernetes `BROWSER_CDP_URL` with an older Browserless token. Installer reruns now update existing profile-level Browserless overrides, `rotate-browser-token` uses the same convergence path, and `doctor.sh` reports root/profile persistence drift instead of checking only the Pod base environment. Explicit, reused, and reconciled Browserless tokens now fail closed unless they use the shell- and URL-query-safe persistence alphabet `[A-Za-z0-9._:/=@-]`; profile roots, profile directories, and `.env` targets must also be non-symlinked.
- Makes bare `rotate-browser-token` generate a fresh token unconditionally instead of silently reusing `BROWSER_TOKEN` loaded from `hermes.env`; deliberate automation values now require process-scoped `BROWSER_TOKEN` plus `--from-env`.
- Restores the previous matching Browserless Secret pair if either Secret update fails during rotation, and makes `doctor.sh` fail when the token and CDP Secrets are missing, malformed, or disagree.

### Documentation

- Updates PVC architecture and troubleshooting guidance for the Node payload/launcher split and custom WebUI image loader-path preservation.

### Verification

- Passes focused Node-launcher tests for unset, inherited, and already-present loader paths; argument and exit-code propagation; npm/npx traversal; optional `libatomic.so.1` handling; trusted execute-bit repair; malformed active-pointer recovery; unexpected-library and same-key content-corruption rebuild; repair idempotency; failed dependency and malformed npm refresh preservation; and validated v1-to-v3 atomic activation with current/previous retention.
- Passes the component/profile matrix, QA contract, full repository shell/Python validation, credential-preservation tests, and encrypted backup tests.
- Passes fresh-PVC transactional QA at code commit `f026107`: malformed-pointer recovery, unexpected-library and payload-corruption rebuild, immediate repair idempotency, forced dependency failure preservation, inherited loader behavior, zero restarts/unexpected warnings, and cleanup.
- Passes the clean live K3s Agent-only, Dashboard, WebUI, Browserless, and full-stack matrix at `f026107`; startup probes reported only expected not-ready events and readiness/liveness produced zero warnings.
- Passes trusted external HTTPS Chromium before and after unchanged reinstall: invalid password rejected, configured password accepted, authenticated screenshots captured, and authenticated consoles clean.
- Passes unchanged reinstall with Secret hash stability, PVC identity preservation, marker integrity, successful rollouts, and complete route/namespace/PV cleanup.
- **Validation limitation:** the live test injects the inherited loader value through the test Pod. Static rendering proves the WebUI Deployment no longer overrides it, but a separately built custom WebUI image with Dockerfile-defined `ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH` was not available.
- Adds `tests/browser-cdp-convergence.sh` covering Secret-pair mismatch refusal, partial-rotation rollback, doctor pair diagnostics, unsafe-token rejection, numeric identity preflight, symlink-boundary protection, atomic root/profile synchronization, consumer rollout annotations, redaction, profile drift diagnostics, and fresh token rotation.

## [v2.6.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Adds `HERMES_AUTH_MODE` with backward-compatible `local-password` and native `external-oidc` application wiring. `disabled` and `external-proxy` remain documentation-only and fail closed when selected. [Issue #95]
- Adds separate Dashboard and WebUI OIDC issuer, client, scope, public/callback URL, and WebUI allow-claim settings. External OIDC rendering removes the shared local password environment references and Dashboard password-login rewrite resources. [Issue #95]
- Adds architecture/maintenance and step-by-step Authelia + FreeIPA documentation, including exact OIDC clients/callbacks, Secret handling, claims policies, migration from an existing local-password installation, rollback, upgrade, backup boundaries, and QA cleanup. [Issue #95]
- Adds `doctor.sh` authentication-mode reporting and external-OIDC drift/conflict checks for live workload environments, local password Secrets, and password-login routing resources.

### Changed

- Makes local Dashboard/WebUI credential generation and `hermes-dashboard-auth` Secret creation conditional on `local-password`, while preserving API-server and Browserless credential behavior in every mode.
- Extends manifest rendering with mutually exclusive local-password and external-OIDC authentication blocks.
- Documents FreeIPA OTP-over-LDAP as an explicit compatibility gate: existing OTP reuse must prove the required FreeIPA bind control/credential path and replay rejection rather than assuming password-plus-OTP concatenation.

### Security

- Prevents `external-oidc` from retaining a weaker local Hermes password path or password-login Ingress.
- Rejects incomplete OIDC settings, non-HTTPS/mismatched callback and public URLs, and unsupported `disabled`/`external-proxy` modes before apply.
- Retains the previous local-password Secret until external-OIDC workloads are Ready, then removes it; failed cutovers leave the previous ReplicaSets restartable.

### Verification

- Passes Bash syntax, Python compilation, component matrix, credential preservation, interactive configuration, authentication-mode doctor, and QA contract tests.
- Passes one isolated full-stack live K3s external-OIDC installation and unchanged reinstall with Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI Ready; verifies OIDC-only workload environment names, absence of `hermes-dashboard-auth`, and absence of the Dashboard password-login Ingress.
- Passes a separate fresh Authelia chart deployment with FreeIPA CA verification, service/user LDAPS binds, Authelia readiness, HTTP health, and OIDC discovery; temporary Namespaces were backed up and removed after validation.
- **Blocked release gate:** the mandatory clean Agent-only, Dashboard, WebUI, Browserless, and full-stack live matrix from `AGENTS.md` has not yet been completed for this branch. Do not release v2.6.0 until that matrix and required Chromium/runtime acceptance checks pass and are recorded.

## [v2.5.0] - 2026-08-24

### Removed

- Removes the deprecated `setup.sh` compatibility wrapper; existing users and automation must invoke `configure.sh` directly. [PR #92]

## [v2.4.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Adds `graylog-api-search` to the canonical shared bootstrap skill catalog: a REST-API-based Graylog log search/aggregation/triage skill that works without a native Graylog MCP connector. Implements `search`, `aggregate`, `fields`, and `trend` (mirroring Graylog 7.1's `search_messages`/`aggregate_messages`/`list_fields` MCP tools), plus `events` (triggered Alerts/Events lookup) and `patterns` (client-side log-pattern clustering) and a `search --count-only` cheap existence check, cherry-picked from comparable Elastic, Grafana/Loki, AWS CloudWatch Logs, and Datadog MCP servers. [PR #90]
- Enables `graylog-api-search` by default for the `universal-system-administrator` profile. [PR #90]
- Adds `tests/api-key-convergence.sh` to verify `hermes-api-server` Secret rotations converge to the same opaque `resourceVersion` across Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI Deployments, and that each runtime can authenticate to `/health/detailed` with the new key. [PR #81, #84]
- Adds `tests/interactive-profile-defaults.py`, a dynamically-discovered real-PTY regression matrix covering Ansible, SSH, and NPX defaults across every bootstrap profile, blank input, explicit true/false answers, saved-answer reuse, and `--from-answers` replay (67 cases across 3 profiles at introduction). Replaces the narrower, now-removed `tests/interactive-ansible-defaults.py` and `tests/interactive-npx-defaults.py`. [PR #82, #85, #86, #87, #88]
- Adds `tests/profile-resolution-model.py`, an architecture contract test that fails if a profile-controlled setting (Ansible/SSH/NPX/addon requirements) is wired through feature-specific plumbing instead of the shared typed resolution model. [PR #87]
- Adds effective-preset display to the interactive wizard: immediately after profile selection, shows the resolved Ansible, SSH, and NPX presets and their origin (selected profile, global fallback, current environment, reused/replayed answer, explicit answer, or Ansible-implies-SSH dependency). The final summary reports the same provenance; secret values are never included. [PR #88]
- Adds `tests/agent-instructions-safety.sh`, a regression that fails if root `AGENTS.md` reintroduces a `wget`/`http://` remote-fetch snippet or any curl/wget piped-to-shell / download-then-execute pattern, and asserts the file's operator-only safety markers are present. [PR #89]

### Changed

- Converges API-key rollout: `install.sh` preflight-renders before writing to Kubernetes, applies `hermes-api-server`, reads its opaque `resourceVersion`, and renders that same non-secret revision annotation into the Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI Deployment templates so an interrupted refresh can no longer leave runtimes authenticating with different keys. `doctor.sh` gained revision-drift diagnostics that never print credential values. [PR #81]
- Restricts explicit/restored `API_SERVER_KEY` values to `[A-Za-z0-9._:/+=@%-]` (rejected rather than normalized) because the resolved key is persisted as an unquoted dotenv/shell assignment on the shared PVC; Dashboard passwords, Browserless tokens, and usernames are unaffected by this API-key-specific restriction. [PR #84]
- Centralizes every profile-controlled wizard setting (Ansible, SSH, NPX, addon requirements) behind one typed declarative resolution model with a single precedence order — interactive choice, reused/replayed saved answer, explicit process/environment value, the selected profile's `defaults.conf`, then the global fallback — replacing duplicated feature-specific prompt/persistence/summary logic and a late `apply_profile_defaults` mutation pass. [PR #87]
- Updates `hermes-workspace-ansible` to `2.0.2`: before deleting, replacing, or archiving Ansible inventory during workspace cleanup, preserves verified non-secret connection metadata (hostname/alias, non-default `ansible_host`, SSH port, verified account, privilege model, confirmed interpreter) for hosts confirmed to persist, while explicitly excluding disposable/temporary/decommissioned targets and never copying credentials, keys, or raw SSH config into inventory. Requires `ansible-inventory --graph` (without `--vars`) validation after consolidation. [PR #80]
- Updates root `AGENTS.md`'s Browserless-pressure diagnostic to reference the existing sanitized `doctor.sh` check instead of an inline `wget`/`http://` snippet that common agent/security scanners flag as a remote-fetch pattern, and marks it explicitly as operator-run rather than for automatic agent execution. [PR #89]

### Fixed

- Fixes the configuration wizard always falling back to a disabled Ansible default on blank input, ignoring the selected bootstrap profile; blank input now resolves through the profile's `defaults.conf`, with Ansible-implies-SSH preserved and saved/explicit answers still taking precedence. [PR #82]
- Fixes the same hard-coded-disabled fallback for the NPX default on blank input. [PR #85]
- Fixes authenticated health checks failing on a clean PVC despite matching Secret/Pod revisions: the init Job now receives `hermes-api-server/api-key` via `secretKeyRef` and atomically upserts `API_SERVER_KEY` (and `BROWSER_CDP_URL`) into the persistent `/opt/data/.env` — preserving unrelated entries, collapsing duplicate managed entries, `umask 077`, mode `0600`, and a same-directory atomic rename. [PR #84]

### Documentation

- Documents the API-key persistence alphabet restriction in `docs/security.md`. [PR #84]
- Updates the README profile-settings paragraph to describe the typed precedence model, Ansible-implies-SSH, and (after PR #88) the effective-preset provenance display shown by the wizard. [PR #87, #88]

## [v2.3.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- Classifies every non-empty bootstrap `related_skills` reference as `bundled`, `external-runtime`, or `optional-reference` while preserving the loader-compatible string lists.
- Validates the complete shared and profile-local bootstrap skill tree: valid YAML frontmatter, non-empty body, matching name/directory, non-empty unique related-skill names, exact classification parity, allowed classification values, and resolution of every bundled reference.

## [v2.3.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Adds `hetzner-ansible-lab` to the canonical shared bootstrap skill catalog with exact upstream provenance, sanitized reporting requirements, labelled temporary-resource cleanup, and mandatory provider-console SSH host-key verification through a run-specific `known_hosts` file.
- Enables `hetzner-ansible-lab` by default for the `universal-system-architect` and `universal-system-administrator` profiles.
- Adds Markdown/PDF runtime packages and `pyvim` to the administrator profile's persistent addon environment.

### Changed

- Moves `ansible-fleet-change`, `linux-change-safety`, and `linux-triage` from profile-local storage into the canonical shared skill catalog while keeping them selected only by `universal-system-administrator`.
- Describes `universal-system-architect` as a curated shared-skill profile instead of claiming that it installs every shared skill.
- Raises the WebUI memory limit default from `1Gi` to `2Gi` in both the public example and the installer fallback.

### Fixed

- Makes WebUI diagnostics require `BROWSER_CDP_URL` only when Browserless is enabled and run WebUI Ansible login-shell checks only when Ansible setup is enabled.
- Adds regression coverage for shared-skill locations and allowlists, imported-skill frontmatter, administrator addon requirements, the WebUI memory fallback/rendered limit, and optional WebUI diagnostic gates.

### Verification

- Passes the complete local test suite and 24 profile/Ansible/requirements matrix combinations.
- Passes isolated live K3s acceptance for Agent-only, Dashboard, WebUI, Browserless, full Architect, full Administrator, invalid-profile failure, and unchanged reinstall cases.
- Verifies real Chromium authentication with trusted TLS and a clean console, Browserless token/CDP/WebSocket behavior, persistent PVC and Secret identity, installed profile skill sets, and complete namespace/PV cleanup.

## [v2.2.3] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Enables persistent SSH setup by default for every bundled profile so fresh installations create one ED25519 identity under `$HOME/.ssh/` without profile-specific surprises.
- Makes ordinary `ssh` select `/opt/data/.ssh/id_ed25519` with `IdentitiesOnly yes` through a PVC-backed wrapper on every runtime PATH, independent of container passwd-home differences, while preserving operator-managed SSH config content.
- Preserves the existing private-key fingerprint across installer reruns and adds doctor checks for effective identity selection, safe permissions, and matching private/public fingerprints.
- Adds a hermetic SSH identity regression test covering first run, unchanged rerun, one-key count, no Kubernetes `subPath` dependency, and effective ordinary `ssh -G` output.
- Keeps the Browserless CDP credential out of the rendered PodSpec; the init Job now expands the `secretKeyRef`-backed environment variable only inside the running container.
- Documents the complete PVC/container architecture, persistent directories, init-container mounts, service wiring, and repository-injected environment variables.
- Makes the interactive wizard honor the selected profile's SSH default, while retaining explicit yes/no overrides.
- Preserves system-wide OpenSSH configuration and inherited helper paths for `ProxyCommand`, `LocalCommand`, and `KnownHostsCommand` without allowing the managed wrapper to recurse.
- Makes a selected bootstrap profile's SOUL effective in `missing` mode when the PVC contains only a recognized generic Hermes/installer identity, while preserving customized, symlinked, and multiply linked `SOUL.md` files and disabled-bootstrap behavior; bootstrap archives are now byte-reproducible so unchanged reruns do not churn the Kubernetes Secret.
- Sets `CODEX_HOME=/opt/data` in every Hermes workload so the Codex CLI uses the persisted OAuth state instead of reporting `Not logged in` after reinstall or Pod replacement.

## [v2.2.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Clarifies that the universal system administrator's production Linux controls apply to separately managed targets, not routine self-maintenance inside the installer-provided Hermes Agent, Dashboard, or WebUI containers.
- Prevents GitHub access setup from inventing `/srv/backup`, `/CHANGES.md`, root, `systemd`, or target-host change-management prerequisites when the active `/opt/data` profile PVC is directly writable.
- Documents live runtime-path detection for hardened containers that omit `/.dockerenv` and Kubernetes ServiceAccount mounts, while preserving explicit authorization for cluster, credential, access, availability, and PVC lifecycle changes.
- Adds profile-composition regression checks for the runtime-versus-target scope boundary.

## [v2.2.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **configure.sh wizard now dynamically discovers bootstrap profiles.** The profile selection menu was hardcoded to only two entries (personal-assistant, universal-system-architect) — the universal-system-administrator profile was never offered. Replaced with a filesystem scanner that lists all directories under `examples/bootstrap-profiles/`. Selection by number or by exact profile name. [PR #65]
- **Missing HERMES_PROFILE_DEFAULT_ADDON_REQUIREMENTS in universal-system-administrator defaults.conf** — caused `unbound variable` in profile-composition tests. [PR #65]
- Updated all tests (`tests/configure.sh`, `tests/profile-composition.sh`, `tests/matrix.sh`) to cover the new dynamic profile discovery and the universal-system-administrator profile.

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-08-11

### Highlights

One minor bump consolidating:
- The **universal-system-administrator** bootstrap profile (PR #60)
- Two coaching skills for the **personal-assistant** profile (PRs #61, #62)
- The interactive `configure.sh` wizard, encrypted full-rollback snapshots, and significant security hardening (accumulated on `main` since v2.1.2)

### Added

**New bootstrap profile**
- Adds `universal-system-administrator` profile — a Linux sysadmin identity (RHCE skill level) for RHEL-family and Debian-family systems. Read-only investigation by default, per-change authorization, `/srv/backup` backup discipline, and `/CHANGES.md` audit trail. Ships three profile-specific skills:
  - `linux-triage` — what-changed reconstruction on existing systems (dual-family package history, log timeline, SELinux/AppArmor, journald)
  - `linux-change-safety` — backup, restore, `/CHANGES.md` entry, SELinux restorecon, rollback
  - `ansible-fleet-change` — canary-first multi-host changes with playbook-generated audit entries

**New coaching skills for personal-assistant profile**
- Adds `systemische-psychologie` skill — professionally researched, neutral systemic/hypnosystemic coaching framework based on Gunther Schmidt. Ships three references: question catalogue, role/safety matrix, and verified sources (DBVC, DGSF, ICF, BDP).
- Adds `coaching-recurring-patterns` skill — values discovery, recurring pattern resolution, resource activation, and daily practice structure with light mode and standard mode. Adaptation vs. change distinction included.
- Adds `POST_SETUP.md` recipe for daily cron-based coaching practice with copy/paste-ready `hermes cron create` examples.

**Infrastructure**
- Adds encrypted full-rollback snapshots: repository-owned Kubernetes resources, application Secrets, normalized metadata, and the exact K3s server version stored inside the age archive. `restore --full` recreates an absent Namespace and enforces K3s/version/Namespace gates; `--force` overrides gates while retaining data-integrity and API failures.
- Adds `restore --full --dry-run` preflight output without Kubernetes or PVC changes.
- Adds configurable `HERMES_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY` with `IfNotPresent` default and explicit `Always` option.
- Adds independently selectable Dashboard, WebUI, and Browser components while keeping Agent mandatory.
- Adds versioned Ansible package installation through `HERMES_ANSIBLE_VERSION`.
- Adds isolated backup-helper regression tests.
- Adds `maintain.sh show-passwords` — retrieves and decodes Kubernetes credential Secrets for an authorized administrator without writing them to local files.

**Configuration wizard**
- Adds an interactive `configure.sh` wizard that stores the complete selected bootstrap and `hermes.env` under Git-ignored `current_config/`, then directs installer artifacts to `current_config/artifacts` during handoff.
- Adds declarative profile skill allowlists and profile environment defaults with operator overrides.
- Generates native Hermes `config.yaml` from the wizard and injects it through bootstrap into persistent `/opt/data/config.yaml`.
- Displays bootstrap profile choices on separate lines for terminal readability.
- Preserves the configuration wizard interactivity when reusing `configuration_answers`: `y` pre-seeds saved non-secret answers, `n` uses built-in defaults, and blank passwords are never stored or offered as defaults.

### Changed

**Profiles and workspace**
- Integrates the generic workspace manager with the existing Git and Ansible workspace skills by defining specialized placement precedence and preventing duplicate topic folders.
- Replaces duplicate root/non-root SSH key installation recipes in the Ansible workspace skill with one idempotent account-aware example.
- Makes `personal-assistant` select `markdown-pdf` and `hermes-workspace-manager` without duplicating canonical skill sources, disable SSH setup by default, and activate its own addon requirements.
- Makes `universal-system-architect` select all shared skills, enable SSH setup, and activate its Ansible-oriented addon requirements by default.
- Makes `HERMES_ANSIBLE_SETUP=false` exclude a profile-provided Ansible workspace from bootstrap content on fresh deployments.
- Adds `universal-system-administrator` row and updates `personal-assistant` with the two new coaching skills in the README profile table.
- Updates the bootstrap workspace instructions, SOUL profile, and README to describe the combined workspace lifecycle.

**Documentation**
- Condenses and reorganizes README around a documented `universal-system-architect` lifecycle: configure, customize `current_config`, install, debug, reconfigure, backup, delete/rebuild, and restore.
- Adds section headers and inline comments to `examples/hermes.env.example` for production readability.
- Uses `configure.sh` as the canonical documented entrypoint while retaining `setup.sh` as a compatibility wrapper.
- Corrects credential, render, and bootstrap artifact paths for both wizard and manual installations.
- Corrects optional-component authentication and deployment claims, conditional SSH preparation, and duplicated operational guidance.

**Installer**
- Makes `install.sh`, `doctor.sh`, and `maintain.sh` automatically discover wizard-generated `current_config/hermes.env` when no root `hermes.env` or explicit `ENV_FILE` is present.
- Removes the temporary composed-profile stage after copying it into the canonical generated bootstrap directory.
- Clears installer library mode before the wizard hands off to `install.sh`, so answering yes starts the deployment.
- Clears internal profile-requirements state before each installer default-resolution pass so sourced or inherited state cannot alter custom requirements.
- Preserves explicit `--from-env` password and browser-token rotation inputs when the active env file contains blank wizard placeholders.
- Changes the default model provider from `codex` to `openai-codex` across the wizard, installer defaults, example configuration, config tests, and maintainer documentation.

**Backup and restore**
- Makes restore remove hidden as well as visible PVC entries and reapplies the configured runtime UID/GID instead of hardcoded `1000:1000` ownership.
- Protects backup archives and generated SHA-256 checksum files with mode `0600`.
- Adds backup/restore cleanup traps and restores each enabled deployment to its original replica count after success or failure.

### Fixed

**Security hardening**
- Adds image-specific Kubernetes security contexts: RuntimeDefault seccomp and disabled ServiceAccount-token automounting for all workloads; no privilege escalation for application containers; numeric non-root Browserless with all capabilities dropped.
- Adds a live-tested security exception for current Agent/Dashboard/WebUI root-start initialization and privileged init-container volume preparation.
- Moves Browserless token rotation from `kubectl --from-literal` process arguments to mode-restricted temporary files passed with `--from-file`, with cleanup traps.
- Adds cleanup traps for all installer and maintenance temporary Secret staging directories, including failed Kubernetes Secret-apply paths.
- Replaces executable `ENV_FILE` sourcing in installer, maintenance, and diagnostics with a non-executing parser for quoted `KEY=value` assignments; unsafe shell environment controls are rejected.
- Ensures the wizard and installer never store or print plaintext credentials; authorized retrieval uses `./maintain.sh show-passwords`.
- Uses native cryptographic password generation via `openssl rand -base64` for Dashboard/WebUI passwords; API keys and Browserless tokens remain hex secrets, no MD5-based generation.
- Updates QA credential acceptance to require Secret-only storage and explicitly reject obsolete local credential-capture-file expectations.
- Validates values crossing YAML and embedded-shell boundaries — Kubernetes names, hosts, image references, resource sizes, numeric settings, paths, and control-character rejection.

**Configuration**
- Preserves existing Dashboard/WebUI, API server, and Browserless credentials during ordinary reinstalls when configuration values are blank; explicit maintenance commands remain the rotation path.
- Preserves an explicit `HERMES_ANSIBLE_CONFIG` override and makes diagnostics validate the configured path rather than requiring the default path.
- Ensures the wizard offers configurable Agent, WebUI, and Browserless image references while retaining `latest` as the default.
- Sets `HERMES_NIX_BUILD=1` for the current WebUI image so its Agent-source dependency installation remains compatible with recent Hermes Agent images that reject normal wheel/sdist builds.

**Documentation**
- Corrects the production walkthrough's bootstrap refresh, answer replay, credential retention, backup validation, namespace deletion, rebuild, and restore semantics.

## [v2.1.2] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- NPX setup is now asked interactively in the `configure.sh` wizard. When
  replaying saved answers (`--from-answers`), the profile default is used.
- Python addon version is now asked in the wizard with version format validation.
  Accepts values like `3.13` or `3.13.5`.
- Both `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` and `HERMES_ADDON_PYTHON_VERSION` are written to
  `hermes.env` and saved to `configuration_answers` for durable replay.

### Changed

- README: adds full reference tables for `scripts/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`
  directories, documenting the purpose of every file in each directory.
- README: documents the three-step profile default resolution chain (explicit
  answer → profile default → hardcoded fallback) with a reference table
  covering SSH, Ansible, NPX, and Python version. [PR #58]

### Fixed

- Minor documentation syntax fixes.

## [v2.1.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Fixes `configure.sh` crashing with `HERMES_NPX_SETUP: unbound variable` when running the interactive wizard. The wizard did not resolve profile-owned variables — adds `apply_profile_defaults()` call after wizard questions so `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` (and any future profile-default variables) are populated from the selected profile's `defaults.conf` before writing the env file and composing bootstrap. [PR #56]

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Adds `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` toggle for npx/npm cache support. When enabled, the init job pre-creates the npm cache directory at `/opt/data/.npm` with correct `hermes:hermes` ownership, and `npm_config_yes=true` is injected into the agent container environment and the terminal profile hook. This prevents `npx`-based MCP servers and skill installers from blocking on interactive prompts or failing with `EACCES` when the agent runs subprocesses as the unprivileged runtime user.
- Adds `HERMES_PROFILE_DEFAULT_NPX_SETUP` to profile defaults: `true` for `universal-system-architect`, `false` for `personal-assistant`.
- Adds `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` validation in `install.sh`, `render_template.py`, and `configure.sh`.

### Changed

- Updates the init job script in `hermes.yaml.tpl` to seed the npm cache directory before the bootstrap chown step.
- Adds `npm_config_yes=true` to the agent deployment env vars in `hermes.yaml.tpl`.
- Adds `export npm_config_yes=true` to the terminal environment hook so login shells inherit the setting.
- Updates `examples/hermes.env.example` with the new `HERMES_NPX_SETUP` section.
- Updates the profile table in README to include the NPX column.

## [v2.0.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Makes the Markdown PDF skill honor `--no-cover` when using the default `fpdf2` backend and corrects its no-cover usage example.
- Neutralizes the reusable team-policy post-setup recipe by replacing repository-specific organization values with explicit `ASK_USER_AND_CHANGE` markers.
- Requires Hermes to resolve every organization marker with the requesting user before installing the adapted policy.

### Changed

- Raises every bundled bootstrap skill version to `2.0.1` for the v2.0.1 release.

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Adds `VERSION` as the release-version source of truth.
- Adds bootstrap skills for general Git workspace lifecycle, Ansible-native workspace lifecycle, and least-privilege public GitHub pull-request access.
- Adds concise post-setup recipes for activating bootstrap skills and adapting a mandatory Hermes team policy.
- Adds contributor and inspiration acknowledgements, including Nicolas Eberle's structured operational use cases and reusable Hermes policy-skill work.

### Changed

- Renames the Ansible workspace skill to `hermes-workspace-ansible` for consistent workspace-skill naming.
- Raises every bundled bootstrap skill version to `2.0.0` for the v2 release line.
- Sets Browserless concurrency to four with a 30-second session timeout and persists/verifies CDP configuration across Hermes components.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Extends persistent HOME/XDG, SSH, addon Python, and Ansible runtime parity to the Dashboard container, matching Agent and WebUI behavior.
- Extends `doctor.sh` to validate HOME/XDG, `ANSIBLE_CONFIG`, SSH key permissions, addon Python, and `ansible localhost -m ping` across Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI.

### Changed

- Simplifies authentication by removing the optional Traefik middleware BasicAuth layer; Dashboard and WebUI application auth remain configured by default.
- Changes the default model to `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Makes persistent `HOME=/opt/data` and XDG directories the fixed default for Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI instead of a configurable `HERMES_HOME_AS_HOME` toggle.
- Simplifies `maintain.sh rotate-passwords` to rotate the shared Dashboard/WebUI password only.
- Keeps operator-managed `config.yaml` intact while replacing only the untouched Agent image default config during init.
- Sets the Browserless default concurrency to `BROWSER_CONCURRENT=4` and session timeout to `BROWSER_TIMEOUT_MS=30000`.
- Documents and persists the Browserless CDP URL in the shared `/opt/data/.env` while retaining Secret-backed `BROWSER_CDP_URL` injection in Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI.

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Sets persistent HOME/XDG and UTF-8 locale for Python addon CLIs in WebUI so uv-managed Ansible can run there.
- Adds a uv-managed persistent addon Python runtime under `/opt/data/uv` so addon CLIs like Ansible work from both Agent and WebUI containers.
- Ensures `/workspace/ansible` is created by default, sets `ANSIBLE_CONFIG`, and documents container mount locations plus visible roles/collections install paths.
- Adds persistent Ansible control-node examples and documentation using the addon venv, workspace bootstrap, and persistent SSH setup.
- Adds persistent Agent HOME/XDG and SSH keypair setup with safe `/opt/data/.ssh` permissions and missing-only key generation.
- Adds opt-in persistent Python addon venv support via `HERMES_ADDON_REQUIREMENTS` and `HERMES_ADDON_VENV`, including manual install documentation.
- Replaces the placeholder bootstrap skill with a reusable `markdown-pdf` skill, including a pip-only renderer, editorial CSS theme, and container-focused verification notes.
- Adds example addon requirements for the bundled `markdown-pdf` workflow and `pyvim`.

### Changed

- Removes duplicate Markdown PDF dependency entries from the example bootstrap requirements file.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- Tunes installer and example resource defaults for small K3s/lab deployments: 100m CPU requests, 1 CPU limits, 256Mi Agent/WebUI memory requests, 96Mi Dashboard memory request, 128Mi Browserless memory request, and 1Gi memory limits.
- Expands the bundled bootstrap `SOUL.md` browser/CDP guidance for direct CDP usage, screenshot validation, and clear fallback behavior when the default CDP endpoint is unavailable.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Adds opt-in bootstrap support through `HERMES_BOOTSTRAP_DIR` for `SOUL.md`, durable memories, skills, plugins, cron configuration, workspace files, and optional authentication state.
- Adds a reusable universal systems-architect bootstrap profile covering platform operations, architecture, research, QA, and software development.
- Exposes the mounted workspace through the Dashboard file browser and configures safe write roots for Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI.

### Changed

- Raises the default WebUI upload limit for large documents.
- Tunes public-example resource requests and limits for practical lab deployments.

### Upgrade notes

- Bootstrap is opt-in. Use `HERMES_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=missing` for normal upgrades.
- `HERMES_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=overwrite` replaces bootstrap-managed data and should be used only after review.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Initial public release of the production-oriented Kubernetes/K3s installer for the Hermes Agent stack.
- Adds template-driven manifests for Hermes Agent Gateway, Hermes Dashboard, Hermes WebUI, and internal Browserless Chromium/CDP support.
- Provides `install.sh` for repeatable namespace-scoped installation, manifest rendering, secret creation, rollout waits, and upgrades.
- Provides `maintain.sh` for status checks, backup/restore, restart, upgrade, password rotation, and Browserless token rotation.
- Provides `doctor.sh` health checks for Kubernetes resources, service readiness, ingress access, WebUI agent wiring, Browserless/CDP connectivity, NetworkPolicy reachability, and Codex OAuth state.
- Documents operations, security, troubleshooting, Codex OAuth pairing, and agent maintainer workflows.
- Includes safe public examples and templates without real hostnames, passwords, tokens, OAuth state, kubeconfig, or generated secrets.
